## ‚ùî Basic Overview

`cub3D` is inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, the first ever first-person shooter. The goal of this project is to implement a dynamic view inside a maze from a first person perspective by utilizing ray-casting. It is obligatory to use `miniLibX`, a graphics library developed by 42Network.

## üìú Game Configuration

It is necessary to provide a `.cub` file to compile the game. The program takes it as a first argument. The file contains the following information:

### ‚ùï Mandatory Part

| EA | East-facing wall texture path | `EA ./path_to_the_east_texture` |
